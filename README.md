# Tiger Compiler

Tiger Compiler is the basic implementation based on *Modern Compiler Implementation in C*, which is written by Andrew W. Appel. It is the course project for *Compilers* in 2021 Fall, SJTU. The following documents for now are scripted by the course TAs.

## Overview

We rewrote the Tiger Compiler labs using the C++ programming language because some features in C++ like inheritance and polymorphism
are more suitable for these labs and less error-prone.

We provide you all the codes of all labs at one time. In each lab, you only
need to code in some of the directories.

## Difference Between C Labs and C++ Labs

1. Tiger compiler in C++ uses [flexc++](https://fbb-git.gitlab.io/flexcpp/manual/flexc++.html) and [bisonc++](https://fbb-git.gitlab.io/bisoncpp/manual/bisonc++.html) instead of flex and bison because flexc++ and bisonc++ is more flexc++ and bisonc++ are able to generate pure C++ codes instead of C codes wrapped in C++ files.

2. Tiger compiler in C++ uses namespace for modularization and uses inheritance and polymorphism to replace unions used in the old labs.

3. Tiger compiler in C++ uses CMake instead of Makefile to compile and build the target.

<!---4. We've introduced lots of modern C++-style codes into tiger compiler, e.g., smart pointers, RAII, RTTI. To get familiar with the features of modern C++ and get recommendations for writing code in modern C++ style, please refer to [this doc](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/courses/compilers/tiger-compiler-cpp-style.html) on our course website.-->

## Installing Dependencies

We provide you a Docker image that has already installed all the dependencies. You can compile your codes directly in this Docker image.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).

2. Run a docker container and mount the lab directory on it.

```bash
# Run this command in the root directory of the project
docker run -it --privileged -p 2222:22 -v $(pwd):/home/stu/tiger-compiler ipadsse302/tigerlabs_env:latest  # or make docker-run
```

## Compiling and Debugging

There are five makeable targets in total, including `test_slp`, `test_lex`, `test_parse`, `test_semant`,  and `tiger-compiler`.

1. Run container environment and attach to it

```bash
# Run container and directly attach to it
docker run -it --privileged -p 2222:22 \
    -v $(pwd):/home/stu/tiger-compiler ipadsse302/tigerlabs_env:latest  # or `make docker-run`
# Or run container in the backend and attach to it later
docker run -dt --privileged -p 2222:22 \
    -v $(pwd):/home/stu/tiger-compiler ipadsse302/tigerlabs_env:latest
docker attach ${YOUR_CONTAINER_ID}
```

2. Build in the container environment

```bash
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make test_xxx  # or `make build`
```

3. Debug using gdb or any IDEs

```bash
gdb test_xxx # e.g. `gdb test_slp`
```

**Note: we will use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` to grade your labs, so make
sure your lab passed the released version**

## Testing Your Labs

Use `make`
```bash
make gradelabx
```
or run the script manually
```bash
./scripts/grade.sh [lab1|lab2|lab3|lab4|lab5|lab6|all] # e.g. `./scripts/grade.sh lab1`
```

You can test all the labs by
```bash
make gradeall
```

## Submitting Your Labs

**Run `make register` and input your name in English and student ID.** You can
check it in the `.info` file generated later.

We are using CI in GitLab to grade your labs automatically. **So please make
sure the `Enable shared runners for this project`
under `Your GitLab repo - Settings - CI/CD` is turned on**.

Push your code to your GitLab repo
```bash
git add somefiles
git commit -m "A message"
git push
```

**Wait for a while and check the latest pipeline (`Your GitLab repo - CI/CD -
Pipelines`) passed. Otherwise, you won't get a full score in your lab.**

## Formatting Your Codes

We provide an LLVM-style .clang-format file in the project directory. You can use it to format your code.

Use `clang-format` command
```
find . \( -name "*.h" -o -iname "*.cc" \) | xargs clang-format -i -style=file  # or make format
```

or config the clang-format file in your IDE and use the built-in format feature in it.

## Other Commands

Utility commands can be found in the `Makefile`. They can be directly run by `make xxx` in a Unix shell. Windows users cannot use the `make` command, but the contents of `Makefile` can still be used as a reference for the available commands.

## Contributing to Tiger Compiler

You can post questions, issues, feedback, or even MR proposals through [our main GitLab repository](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn:2020/compilers-2021/compilers-2021/issues). We are rapidly refactoring the original C tiger compiler implementation into modern C++ style, so any suggestion to make this lab better is welcomed.
